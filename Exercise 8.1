1. (Review) What are the three items associated with the variable named total?

The variable named total has these 3 items associated with it:the value stored in the variable, the number of bytes reserved for the variable, 
and where in memory these bytes are located

2. (Review) If average is a variable, what does &average mean?



3. (Practice) For the variables and addresses in Figure 8.9, determine the addresses corresponding
to the expressions &temp, &dist, &date, and &miles.
Addresses: 16892 16893 16894 16895 16896 16897 16898 16899
Addresses: 16900 16901 16902 16903 16904 16905 16906 16907
Addresses: 16908 16909 16910 16911 16912 16913 16914 16915

4. (Practice) a. Write a C++ program that includes the following declaration statements. Have
the program use the address operator and a cout statement to display the addresses corresponding
to each variable.

intƒnum,ƒcount;
longƒdate;
floatƒslope;
doubleƒyield;



b. After running the program written for Exercise 4a, draw a diagram of how your computer
has set aside storage for the variables in the program. On your diagram, fill in the addresses
the program displays.



c. Modify the program written in Exercise 4a (using the sizeof() operator discussed in
Section 2.1) to display the amount of storage your computer reserves for each data type.
With this information and the address information provided in Exercise 4b, determine
whether your computer set aside storage for the variables in the order in which they were
declared.



5. (Review) If a variable is declared as a pointer, what must be stored in the variable?



6. (Practice) Using the indirection operator, write expressions for the following:
a. The variable pointed to by xAddr
b. The variable whose address is in yAddr
c. The variable pointed to by ptYld
d. The variable pointed to by ptMiles
e. The variable pointed to by mptr
f. The variable whose address is in pdate
g. The variable pointed to by distPtr
h. The variable pointed to by tabPt
i. The variable whose address is in hoursPt



7. (Practice) Write declaration statements for the following:
a. The variable pointed to by yAddr is an integer.
b. The variable pointed to by chAddr is a character.
c. The variable pointed to by ptYr is a long integer.
d. The variable pointed to by amt is a double-precision variable.
e. The variable pointed to by z is an integer.
f. The variable pointed to by qp is a single-precision variable.
g. datePt is a pointer to an integer.
h. yldAddr is a pointer to a double-precision variable.
i. amtPt is a pointer to a single-precision variable.
j. ptChr is a pointer to a character variable.



8. (Review) a. What are the variables yAddr, chAddr, ptYr, amt, z, qp, datePt, yldAddr,
amtPt, and ptChr used in Exercise 7 called?
b. Why are the variable names amt, z, and qp used in Exercise 7 not good choices for
pointer names?



9. (Practice) Write English sentences that describe what’s contained in the following declared
variables:
a. char *keyAddr;
b. int *m;
c. double *yldAddr;
d. long *yPtr;
e. double *pCou;
f. int *ptDate;



10. (Practice) Which of the following is a declaration for a pointer?
a. long a;
b. char b;
c. char *c;
d. int x;
e. int *p;
f. double w;
g. float *k;
h. float l;
i. double *z;

11. (Practice) For the following declarations,
int *xPt, *yAddr;
long *dtAddr, *ptAddr;
double *ptZ;
int a;
long b;
double c;
determine which of the following statements is valid:
a. yAddr = &a; b. yAddr = &b; c. yAddr = &c;
d. yAddr = a; e. yAddr = b; f. yAddr = c;
g. dtAddr = &a; h. dtAddr = &b; i. dtAddr = &c;
j. dtAddr = a; k. dtAddr = b; l. dtAddr = c;
m. ptZ = &a; n. ptAddr = &b; o. ptAddr = &c;
p. ptAddr = a; q. ptAddr = b; r. ptAddr = c;
s. yAddr = xPt; t. yAddr = dtAddr; u. yAddr = ptAddr;



12. (Practice) For the variables and addresses in Figure 8.10, fill in the data determined by the
following statements:
a. ptNum = &m;
b. amtAddr = &amt;
c. *zAddr = 25;
d. k = *numAddr;
e. ptDay = zAddr;
f. *ptYr = 2011;
g. *amtAddr = *numAddr;
