1. (Practice) A C++ program is required that calculates the amount, in dollars, contained in a
piggybank. The bank contains half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
a. For this programming problem, how many outputs are required?
one output is required (amount)
b. How many inputs does this problem have?
10 inputs are required (half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, number of each(5))
c. Write an algorithm for converting the input items into output items.
(half * halfNum)+(quart * quartNum)+(dim * dimNum)+(nick *nickNum)+(pen * penNum) = amount
d. Test the algorithm written for Exercise 1c using the following sample data: half dollars 0,
quarters 17, dimes 24, nickels 16, and pennies 12.
(.50 * 0 )+(.25 * 17)+(.10 * 24)+(.05 * 16)+(.01* 12) = 7.57
2. (Practice) A C++ program is required to calculate the value of distance, in miles, given this
relationship:
distance = average - speed × time
a. For this programming problem, how many outputs are required?
one out is reqired (distance)
b. How many inputs does this problem have?
three inputs are required (average, speed and time)
c. Write an algorithm for converting the input items into output items.
average - speed x time = distance
d. Test the algorithm written for Exercise 2c using the following sample data: speed is 55 miles
per hour and time is 2.5 hours.
average - (55 x 2.5) = distance
e. How must the algorithm you wrote in Exercise 2c be modified if the elapsed time is given
in minutes instead of hours?
average - speed x time(60) = distance

Fergies x Lergies = Ergies
d. Test the algorithm written for Exercise 3c using the following sample data: Fergies = 14.65
and Lergies = 4.
14.65 x 4 = 58.6
4. (Practice) A C++ program is required to display the following name and address:

5. (Practice) A C++ program is required to determine how far a car has traveled after 10 seconds,
assuming the car is initially traveling at 60 mph and the driver applies the brakes to decelerate
at a uniform rate of 12 miles/sec2. Use the following formula:
distance = st - (1/2)dt2
s is the initial speed of the car.
d is the deceleration.
t is the elapsed time.

proceeds of that sale had been deposited in a Dutch bank paying 5% interest, compounded
annually, what would the principal balance be at the end of 2012? The following display is
required; xxxxxx is the amount calculated by the program:

7. (Practice) A C++ program is required that calculates and displays the weekly gross pay and
net pay of two employees. The first employee is paid an hourly rate of $16.43, and the second
is paid an hourly rate of $12.67. Both employees have 20% of their gross pay withheld for
income tax, and both pay 2% of their gross pay, before taxes, for medical benefits.
