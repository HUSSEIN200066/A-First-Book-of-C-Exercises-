1. (Program) Enter and run Program 1.1 on a computer. (Note: You must understand the procedures
for entering and running a C++ program on the particular computer installation
you’re using.)
--------------------------------------------------
#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "Hello there world!"<<endl;
	system ("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

2. (Program) a. Using cout, write a C++ program that prints your name on one line, your street
address on a second line, and your city, state, and zip code on the third line.
-----------------------------------------------------
#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "Patrick Hentz"<<endl<<"7381 Eureka Road" <<endl<< "Batesville " << "Mississippi " << 38606 << endl;
	system ("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
b. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 2a on a computer.
Done!!
3. (Program) a. Write a C++ program to display the following verse:
Computers,computers everywhere
as far as I can see.
I really,really like these things,
Oh joy, Oh joy for me!
-------------------------------------------------------
#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "Computers, computers everywhere";
		cout << "\n as far as I can see.";
		cout << "\n I really, really like these things, ";
		cout <<"\n Oh joy, Oh joy for me!"<< endl;
	system ("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
b. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 3a on a computer.
Done!!
4. (Practice) a. How many cout statements would you use to display the following?
---------------------------------------------------------
Five (not including the lines under the column headings)

PART NO.      PRICE
T1267         $6.34
T1300         $8.92
T2401         $65.40
T4482         $36.99

b. What’s the minimum number of cout statements that could be used to print the table in
Exercise 4a?
------------------------------------------------------
Only one is needed to print the table in Exercise 4a. 

c. Write a complete C++ program to produce the output shown in Exercise 4a.
#include "stdafx.h"
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "PART NO.    PRICE";
	cout << "\n T1267       $6.34";
	cout << "\n T1300       $8.92";
	cout << "\n T2401       $65.40";
	cout << "\n T4482       $36.99 "<< endl;
	system ("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

d. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 4c on a computer.
Done!!
5. (For thought) In response to a newline escape sequence, cout positions the next displayed
character at the beginning of a new line. This positioning of the next character actually represents
two distinct operations. What are they?
---------------------------------------
Carriage return and line feed
