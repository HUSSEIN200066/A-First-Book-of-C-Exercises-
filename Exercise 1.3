1. (Program) Enter and run Program 1.1 on a computer. (Note: You must understand the procedures
for entering and running a C++ program on the particular computer installation
you’re using.)

2. (Program) a. Using cout, write a C++ program that prints your name on one line, your street
address on a second line, and your city, state, and zip code on the third line.
b. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 2a on a computer.

3. (Program) a. Write a C++ program to display the following verse:
Computers,computers everywhere
as far as I can see.
I really,really like these things,
Oh joy, Oh joy for me!
b. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 3a on a computer.
4. (Practice) a. How many cout statements would you use to display the following?
PARTƒNO.      PRICE
T1267         $6.34
T1300         $8.92
T2401         $65.40
T4482         $36.99
b. What’s the minimum number of cout statements that could be used to print the table in
Exercise 4a?
c. Write a complete C++ program to produce the output shown in Exercise 4a.
d. Run the program you wrote for Exercise 4c on a computer.
5. (For thought) In response to a newline escape sequence, cout positions the next displayed
character at the beginning of a new line. This positioning of the next character actually represents
two distinct operations. What are they?
