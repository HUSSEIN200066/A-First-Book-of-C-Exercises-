1. (Review) State whether a stack is appropriate for each of the following tasks, and indicate why
or why not:
a. A word-processing program must remember a line of up to 80 characters. Pressing the
Backspace key deletes the previous character, and pressing Ctrl+Backspace deletes the
entire line. Users must be able to undo deletion operations.
b. Customers must wait one to three months for delivery of their new cars. The dealer creates
a list to determine the “fair” order in which customers should get their cars; the list is prepared
in the order in which customers placed their requests for a new car.
c. You’re required to search downward in a pile of magazines to locate the issue for last
January. Each magazine was placed on the pile as soon as it was received.
d. A programming team accepts jobs and prioritizes them on the basis of urgency.
e. A line forms at a bus stop.
2. (Practice) Enter and run Program 13.3.
3. (Modify) Modify Program 13.3 to implement a stack of integers rather than a stack of strings.
4. (Modify) Modify Program 13.3 to instantiate three stacks of digits named digits1, digits2,
and digits3. Initialize digits1 to contain the digits 9, 8, 5, and 2, which is the number 2589
in reverse order. Similarly, the digits2 stack should be initialized to contain the digits 3, 1, 5,
and 7, which is the number 7513 in reverse order. Calculate and place the sum of these two
numbers in the digits3 stack. This sum should be obtained by popping objects from
digits1 and digits2 and adding them together with a variable named carry, which is initialized
to 0. If the sum of the two popped objects and carry doesn’t exceed 10, the sum
should be pushed onto digits3 and carry should be set to 0; otherwise, carry should be set
to 1, and the units digit of the sum should be pushed onto the digits3 stack.
5. (Program) Write a C++ program that allows a user to enter a maximum of 100 integers in a
stack object. Then have the program do the following:
a. Reverse the stack’s contents into a second stack of integers.
b. Using two additional stacks, reverse the contents in the original stack. For example, if the
original stack contains the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4, it should contain the integers 4, 3, 2, and 1
at the end of the program.
6. (Program) Write a C++ program that allows a user to enter a maximum of 50 characters in a
stack object. Then have the program sort the stack contents in increasing order. For example,
if the stack’s contents are initially D, E, A, and B, its final contents are A, B, D, and E.
