1. (Program) Include the copy constructor and assignment operator explained in this section in
Program 12.6, and run the program to verify their operation.

2. (Program) Write a suitable destructor method for Program 12.6.

3. (Program) a. Construct a class named Car containing these four data members: a doubleprecision
variable named engineSize, a character variable named bodyStyle, an integer
variable named colorCode, and a character pointer named vinPtr to a vehicle ID code. The
member functions should include a constructor that provides default values of 0 for each
numeric data member, an X for each character variable, and a NULL for each pointer; a display
function that prints the engine size, body style, color code, and vehicle ID code; and an assignment
operator that performs a memberwise assignment between two Car objects and handles
the pointer member correctly.

b. Include the class written for Exercise 3a in a working C++ program that creates two Car
objects; the second object should be assigned the values of the first object.

4. (Modify) Modify Program 12.6 to include the assignment statement bƒ=ƒa, and then run the
modified program to assess any error messages that occur.

5. (Modify) Using Program 12.6 as a start, write a program that creates five Book objects. The
program should allow the user to enter the five book titles interactively and then display the
titles entered.

6. (Modify) Modify the program written in Exercise 5 so that the program sorts the entered book
titles in alphabetical order before it displays them. (Hint: You have to define a sort routine for
the titles; refer back to Section 7.7.)
