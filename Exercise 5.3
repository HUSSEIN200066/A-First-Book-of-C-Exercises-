  return 0;
}
20, 16, 12, 8, 4, 0
5. (Modify) Modify Program 5.10 to produce a table of the numbers 0 through 20 in increments
of 2, with their squares and cubes.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	const int MAXNUMS = 20;
	int num;
	cout << endl;      // print a blank line
	cout << "NUMBER   SQUARE   CUBE\n"

			<< setw(3) << num * num << "     "
			<< setw(4) << num * num * num << endl;
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

6. (Modify) Modify Program 5.10 to produce a table of numbers from 10 to 1, instead of 1 to 10,
as it currently does.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	const int MAXNUMS = 0;
	int num;
	cout << endl;      // print a blank line
	cout << "NUMBER   SQUARE   CUBE\n"

}
7. (Program) a. Write, compile, and run a C++ program that displays a table of 20 temperature
conversions from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The table should start with a Fahrenheit value of
20 degrees and be incremented in values of 4 degrees. Recall that Celsius = (5.0/9.0) ×
(Fahrenheit - 32.0).

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS = 96;
	int num;
	double Celsius, Fahrenheit;
	cout << endl;      // print a blank line
	
	cout << "Celsius       Fahrenheit \n"
		<< "------      ------   \n"; 
	
	for (Fahrenheit = 20; Fahrenheit <= MAXNUMS; Fahrenheit = Fahrenheit + 4)
	{
		Celsius = (5.0 / 9.0)*(Fahrenheit - 32.0);
		cout << setw(10) << Celsius 
			<< setw(10) << Fahrenheit << endl;
	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

b. Modify the program written for Exercise 7a to request the number of conversions to be made.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS;
	int num;
	double Celsius, Fahrenheit;
	cout << endl;      // print a blank line
	cout << "Enter number of coversions to be made" << endl;
	cin >> MAXNUMS;
	cout << "Celsius       Fahrenheit \n"
		<< "------      ------   \n";

		cout << setw(10) << Celsius 
			<< setw(10) << Fahrenheit << endl;
	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
8. (Program) Write, compile, and run a C++ program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature
in increments of 5 degrees. The initial value of Fahrenheit temperature and the total
conversions to be made should be requested as user input during program execution. Recall
that Celsius = (5.0/9.0) × (Fahrenheit - 32.0).
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS;
	int num;
	double Celsius, Fahrenheit;
	cout << endl;      // print a blank line
	cout << "Enter Fahrenheit"<< endl;
	cin >> Fahrenheit;
	cout << "Enter total conversions" << endl;
	cin >> MAXNUMS;
	cout << "Celsius       Fahrenheit \n"
		<< "------      ------   \n"; 
	
	for (Fahrenheit; Fahrenheit <= MAXNUMS; Fahrenheit = Fahrenheit + 5)
	{
		Celsius = (5.0 / 9.0)*(Fahrenheit - 32.0);
		cout << setw(10) << Celsius 
			<< setw(10) << Fahrenheit << endl;
	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
9. (Program) a. Write, compile, and run a C++ program that accepts five values of gallons, one
at a time, and converts each value entered to its liter equivalent before the next value is
requested. Use a for loop in your program. There are 3.785 liters in 1 gallon of liquid.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS = 5;
	double liters, gallons;
	cout << "\nThis program wil ask you to enter" << MAXNUMS << "numbers.\n";
	for (gallons = 0; gallons <= MAXNUMS; gallons++)
	{
		cout << "\nEnater a number: ";
		cin >> gallons;
		liters = 3.785 * gallons;
		cout << liters << endl;
		cout << gallons << endl;
	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
b. Modify the program written for Exercise 9a to request the number of data items to be
entered and converted first.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS;
	double liters, gallons;
	cout << "Enter number of data items to be enter and converted" << endl;
	cin >> MAXNUMS;
	cout << "\nThis program wil ask you to enter " << MAXNUMS << " numbers.\n";
	for (gallons = 0; gallons <= MAXNUMS; gallons++)
	{
		cout << "\nEnater a number: ";
		cin >> gallons;
		liters = 3.785 * gallons;
		cout << liters << endl;
		cout << gallons << endl;
	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

10. (Program) a. An old Arabian legend has it that a fabulously wealthy but unthinking king
agreed to give a beggar 1 cent and double the amount for 64 days. Using this information,
write, compile, and run a C++ program that displays how much the king must pay the beggar
on each day. The output of your program should appear as follows:
       Day      Amount Owed
       ---      -----------
        1          0.01
        2          0.02
        3          0.04
        .           .
        .           .
        .           .
       64           .

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int MAXNUMS = 64;
	double amount_owed = .01;
	cout << "Day           Amount Owed" << endl;
	cout << "------- - -----------------" << endl;
	for (int day = 1;  day<= MAXNUMS; day++)
	{

		amount_owed = amount_owed * 2;
		cout << setw(5)<< day  
	 << setw(20) << amount_owed << endl;

	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
b. Modify the program you wrote for Exercise 10a to determine on which day the king will
have paid the beggar a total of one million dollars.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double MAXNUMS = 64;
	double amount_owed = .01;
	double total = 0;
	cout << "Day           Amount Owed" << endl;
	cout << "------- - -----------------" << endl;
	for (int day = 1;  day<= MAXNUMS; day++)
	{

		amount_owed = amount_owed * 2;
		total = total + amount_owed;
		cout << setw(5)<< day  
	 << setw(20) << amount_owed 
	 << setw(20) << total <<endl;
		if (total >= 1000000){
			cout << "I just gave you a million dollars or more on this day " << day << endl;
		}

	}
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
11. (Debug) Is the following program correct? If it is, determine its output. If it’s not, determine
the error and correct it so that the program will run.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
    cout << i << ‘\n’;
  for (j = 1; i < 5; i++)
    cout << i << endl;
  return 0;
}
----------------Corrected--------------------

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++){
		cout << i << '\n';
	}
		for (int j = 1; j < 5; j++){
			cout << j << endl;
		}
	
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

12. (Program) a. Write, compile, and run a C++ program that calculates and displays the amount
of money available in a bank account that initially has $1000 deposited and earns interest at
the rate of 3% a year. Your program should display the amount available at the end of each year
for a period of 10 years. Use the relationship that the money available at the end of each year
= the amount of money in the account at the start of the year + .03 × the amount available at
the start of the year.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double money = 1000;

	for (double year= 1; year <= 10; year++){
		money = money + .03 * money;
		cout << money<< '\n';
	}

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

b. Modify the program written for Exercise 12a to prompt the user for the amount of money
initially deposited in the account.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double money;
	cout << "Enter your initial money in your account" << endl;
	cin >> money;
	
	for (double year= 1; year <= 10; year++){
		money = money + .03 * money;
		cout << money<< '\n';
	}

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
c. Modify the program written for Exercise 12a to prompt the user for both the amount of
money initially deposited and the number of years to be displayed.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double money,numyears;
	cout << "Enter your initial money in your account" << endl;
	cin >> money;
	cout << "Enter the number of years too" << endl;
	cin >> numyears;
	for ( double years= 1; years <= numyears; years++){
		money = money + .03 * money;
		cout << money<< '\n';
	}

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

d. Modify the program written for Exercise 12a to prompt the user for the amount of money
initially deposited, the interest rate to be used, and the number of years to be displayed.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double money,numyears,interest;
	cout << "Enter your initial money in your account" << endl;
	cin >> money;
	cout << "Enter the number of years too" << endl;
	cin >> numyears;
	cout << "Enter the intrest rate last one promise" << endl;
	cin >> interest;
	for ( double years= 1; years <= numyears; years++){
		money = money + interest * money;
		cout << money<< '\n';
	}

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
13. (Program) According to legend, the island of Manhattan was purchased from the native
Indian population in 1626 for $24. Assuming this money was invested in a Dutch bank paying
4% simple interest per year, construct a table showing how much money the native population
would have at the end of each 50-year period, starting in 1626 and ending 400 years later. Use
the relationship that the money available at the end of each 50-year period = the amount of
money in the account at the start of period × the quantity (1 + .04)50.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double money = 24,numyears = 10;
	
	for ( double years= 1626; years <= numyears; years = years + 50){
		money = 24 * money *(1 + .04)*50;
		cout << money<< '\n';
		cout << years << endl;
	}

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

14. (Program) A well-regarded manufacturer of widgets has been losing 4% of its sales each year.
The company’s annual profit is 10% of sales. This year, the company has had $10 million in
sales and a profit of $1 million. Determine the expected sales and profit for the next 10 years.
Your program should produce a display in the following form:
            SALES AND PROFIT PROJECTION
            ---------------------------
YEAR        EXPECTED SALES        PROJECTED PROFIT

	cout << "--------         --------------------    ---------------------" << endl;

	for ( double years= 1; years <= numyears; years++){
		loses = years * expected * .04;
		loses2 = years * profit *.04;
			profit = profit - loses2;

	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
15. (Program) Four experiments are performed, and each experiment has six test results. The
results for each experiment are given in the following list. Write, compile, and run a C++ program
using a nested loop to compute and display the average of the test results for each
experiment.
1st experiment results: 23.2 31 16.9 27.5 25.4 28.6
2nd experiment results: 34.8 45.2 27.9 36.8 33.4 39.4
3rd experiment results: 19.4 16.8 10.2 20.8 18.9 13.4
4th experiment results: 36.9 39.5 49.2 45.1 42.7 50.6

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double average = 0;
	double result = 0;
	double solution;

	for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++){

		for (int j = 1; j <= 6; j++){
			cout << i <<"st "<< " experiment results:";
				cin >> result;
				average = average + result;
				solution = average / 6;
		}
		
		cout << solution << endl;
	}


	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

16. (Modify) Modify the program written for Exercise 15 so that the number of test results for
each experiment is entered by the user. Write your program so that a different number of test
results can be entered for each experiment.

17. (Program) a. A bowling team consists of five players, and each player bowls three games.
Write, compile, and run a C++ program that uses a nested loop to enter each player’s scores
and then computes and displays the average score for each bowler. Assume each bowler has
the following scores:
1st bowler: 286 252 265
2nd bowler: 212 186 215
3rd bowler: 252 232 216
4th bowler: 192 201 235
5th bowler: 186 236 272

b. (Modify) Modify the program written for Exercise 17a to calculate and display the average
team score. (Hint: Use a second variable to store the total of all players’ scores.)

c. (Modify) Rewrite the program written for Exercise 17a to eliminate the inner loop. To do
this, you have to input three scores for each bowler rather than enter one at a time. Each
score must be stored in its own variable name before the average is calculated.

18. (Program) Write, compile, and run a C++ program that calculates and displays the yearly
amount available if $1000 is invested in a bank account for 10 years. Your program should
display the amounts available for interest rates from 6% to 12%, inclusive, in 1% increments.
Use a nested loop, with the outer loop having a fixed count of 7 and the inner loop having a
fixed count of 10. The first iteration of the outer loop should use an interest rate of 6% and
display the amount of money available at the end of the first 10 years. In each subsequent pass
through the outer loop, the interest rate should be increased by 1%. Use this relationship:
money available at end of each year = amount of money in account at start of the year + interest
rate × amount available at start of the year.
