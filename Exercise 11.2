1. (Practice) Enter and run Program 11.4.

2. (Modify) a. Modify all the member methods in Program 11.4 to use the this pointer. For
example, the expression month = mm should be replaced by this->month = mm.

b. Run the program written for Exercise 2a to verify that your modified program produces the
same output as Program 11.4.

3. (Practice) Enter and run Program 11.5.

4. (Modify) a. Modify Program 11.5 to use the last version of swap() shown in this section.
Make sure to modify the method prototype for swap() and the call statement.

b. Run the program written for Exercise 4a to verify that the swap() method using a reference
argument produces the same result as Program 11.5.

5. (Desk check) In place of the prototype and method header for swap() used in Program 11.5,
a student used the following:
void swap(Date);   // method prototype
void Date::swap(Date temp)  // method header
a. Determine what Program 11.5 will produce if these two changes are made.

b. Verify your answer to Exercise 5a by making the changes and running the modified program.

6. (Desk check) a. Determine what the following method does when called by the statement
newDate.addSixMonths(&oldDate);:
void Date::addSixMonths(Date *pt)  //method to add 6 months
{
  pt->month = pt->month + 6;       // add 6 months to the date
  //adjust the “pointed to” date's month and year
  if(pt->month > 12) // adjust the month and year
  {
    pt->month = pt->month - 12;
    pt->year++;  //add 1 to the year
  }
    day = pt->day;
  month=pt->month;
  year = pt->year;
  return;
}

b. Include the addSixMonths() method given in Exercise 6a in Program 11.5 and verify your
answer to Exercise 6a.

7. (Modify) a. Modify the addSixMonths() method given in Exercise 6a to use a reference
argument rather than a pointer.

b. Include the addSixMonths() method written for Exercise 7a in Program 11.5 and verify
that this method works as expected.

8. (Modify) a. Modify the addSixMonths() method given in Exercise 6a so that it doesn’t alter
the data values in the passed object. Do this by passing a copy of oldDate (rather than a
pointer or a reference) to the method.

b. Include the addSixMonths() method written for Exercise 8a in Program 11.5 and verify
that this method works as expected.
