1. (Review) Define the following terms:
a. inheritance d. simple inheritance
b. base class e. multiple inheritance
c. derived class f. class hierarchy
2. (Review) Describe the difference between private and protected class members.
3. (Review) What three features must a programming language include to be classified as an
object-oriented language?
4. (Modify) a. Modify Program 12.1 to include a derived class named Sphere from the base
Circle class. The only additional class members of Sphere should be a constructor and a
calcval() function that returns the sphere’s volume. (Note: Volume = 4 / 3 πr3.)
b. Include the class constructed for Exercise 4a in a working C++ program. Have your program
call all the member functions in the Sphere class.
5. (Program) a. Create a base class named Point consisting of x and y data members representing
point coordinates. From this class, derive a class named Circle with another data member
named radius. For this derived class, the x and y data members represent a circle’s center
coordinates. The member functions of the Point class should consist of a constructor, an
area() function that returns 0, and a distance() function that returns the distance between
two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where
distance = (x - x ) + (y - y ) 2 1

2 1

Additionally, the derived class should have a constructor and an override function named
area() that returns a circle’s area.
b. Include the classes constructed for Exercise 5a in a working C++ program. Have your program
call all the member functions in each class. In addition, call the base class’s
distance() function with two Circle objects and explain the result this function returns.
6. (Modify) a. Using the classes constructed for Exercise 5a, derive a class named Cylinder
from the Circle class. The Cylinder class should have a constructor and a member function
named area() that determines a cylinder’s surface area. For this function, use the algorithm
surface area = 2 π r (l + r), where r is the radius of the cylinder and l is the length.
b. Include the classes constructed for Exercise 6a in a working C++ program. Have your program
call all the member functions in the Cylinder class.
c. What do you think the result might be if the Point (base) class’s distance() function is
called with two Cylinder objects?
7. (Program) a. Create a base class named Rectangle containing length and width data members.
From this class, derive a class named Box with another data member named depth. The
member functions of the base Rectangle class should consist of a constructor and an area()
function. The derived Box class should have a constructor, a volume() function, and an override
function named area() that returns the surface area of the box.
b. Include the classes constructed for Exercise 7a in a working C++ program. Have your program
call all the member functions in each class, and verify the results manually.
