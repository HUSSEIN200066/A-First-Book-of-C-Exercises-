1. (Practice) State whether the following are valid identifiers and if so, whether they’re mnemonic
names that convey some idea of their purpose. If the identifier names are invalid,
state why.
1m1234 newBal abcd A12345 1A2345
power absVal invoices do while
add_5 taxes netPay 12345 int
newBalance a2b3c4d5 sales_tax amount $taxes

2. (Practice) Assume the following functions have been written:
getLength(),ƒgetWidth(),ƒcalcArea(),ƒdisplayArea()
a. Based on their names, what do you think each function might do?
b. In what order do you think a main() function might execute these functions (based on
their names)?
3. (Practice) Assume the following functions have been written:
inputPrice(),ƒcalcSalestax(),ƒcalcTotal()
a. Based on their names, what do you think each function might do?
b. In what order do you think a main() function might execute these functions (based on
their names)?
4. (Practice) Determine names for functions that do the following:
a. Find the average of a set of numbers.
b. Find the area of a rectangle.
c. Find the circumference of a circle.
d. Find the maximum value in a set of numbers.
e. Convert an uppercase letter to a lowercase letter.
f. Sort a set of numbers from lowest to highest.
g. Alphabetize a list of names.
5. (Practice) Just as the keyword int can be used to signify that a function returns an integer,
the keywords void, char, float, and double can be used to signify that a function returns no
value, a character, a floating-point number, and a double-precision number, respectively. Using
this information, write header lines for a function named abs() that receives no arguments but
returns the following:
a. No value
b. A character
c. A floating-point number
d. A double-precision number
