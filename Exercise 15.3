1. (Practice) Write two declaration statements that can be used in place of the declaration
char text[] = “Hooray!”;.

2. (Desk check) Determine the value of *text, *(text + 3), and *(text + 7) for each of
the following sections of code:
a. char *text;
char message[] = “the check is in the mail”;
text = message;

b. char *text;
char formal[] = {'T','h','i','s','','i','s','','a','n','', 
                   'i','n','v','i','t','a','t','i','o','n','\0'};
text = &formal[0];

c. char *text;
char more[] = “Happy Holidays”;
text = &more[4];

d. char *text, *second;
char blip[] = “The good ship”;
second = blip;
text = ++second;

3. (Debug) Determine the error in the following program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int i = 0;
  char message[] = {'H','e','l','l','o','\0'};
  for( ; i < 5; i++)
  {
    cout << *message;
    message++;
  }
  return 0;
}



4. (Program) a. Write a C++ function that displays the day of the week corresponding to a userentered
number between 1 and 7. That is, in response to the input 2, the program displays the
name Monday. Use an array of pointers in the function.

b. Include the function written for Exercise 4a in a complete working program.

5. (Modify) Modify the function written in Exercise 4a so that it returns the address of the character
string containing the correct day to be displayed.



6. (Program) Write a function that accepts 10 lines of user-entered text and stores them as
10 C-strings. Use a pointer array in your function.
