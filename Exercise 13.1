1. (Review) Define the following terms:

a. Container - The STL lists and arrays are held in containers
b. Collection - The STL list and arrays are considered collections
c. Data structure - is a container of data organized in a way that facilitates inserting, retrieving, and deleting data.
d. Iterator - are used to spacify the means of accessing list objects, in much the same way as in index does for an array.
e. List - is considered a container that can hold a collection of zero or more items of the same type.
f. Standard Template Library - provides a tested and generic set of easyly used lists that can be maintained in various configurations.

2. (Review) What sequential container types are supported in the STL?



3. (Review) What associative container types are supported in the STL?



4. (Practice) For each of the following, define a class containing only a class declaration section
that can be used to create the following objects:

a. An object (known as a student record) containing a student ID number, the number of
credits completed, and a cumulative grade point average



b. An object (known as a student record) capable of holding a student’s name, date of birth,
number of credits completed, and cumulative grade point average



c. A mailing list containing a title field, last name field, first name field, two street address
fields, a city field, a state field, and a zip code field



d. A stock object containing the stock’s name, the purchase price, and the date of purchase



e. An inventory object containing an integer part number, a string part description, an integer
number of parts in inventory, and an integer reorder value



5. (Practice) For each class declared in Exercise 4, add a suitable constructor and accessor
method. Test each method to initialize and display the following data:
a. ID Number: 4672
Number of Credits Completed: 68
Grade Point Average: 3.01



b. Name: Rhona Karp
Date of Birth: 8/4/60
Number of Credits Completed: 96
Grade Point Average: 3.89




c. Title: Dr.
Last Name: Kingsley
First Name: Kay
Address 1: Apt. 2B
Address 2: 614 Freeman Street
City: Indianapolis
State: IN
Zip Code: 07030



d. Stock: IBM
Purchase Price: 134.5
Date Purchased: 10/1/2010



e. Part Number: 16879
Description: Battery
Number in Stock: 10
Reorder Number: 3



6. (Program) a. Write a C++ program that prompts a user to input the current month, day, and
year. Store the data entered in a suitably defined object and display the date in an appropriate
manner.



b. Modify the program written in Exercise 6a to use an object that accepts the current time in
hours, minutes, and seconds.



7. (Program) Define a class capable of creating objects that can store a business’s name, description
of its product or services, address, number of employees, and annual revenue.



8. (Practice) Define a class capable of creating objects for different screw types held in inventory.
Each object should contain a field for an integer inventory number, a double-precision
screw length, a double-precision diameter, the kind of head (Phillips or standard slot), the
material (steel, brass, other), and the cost.



9. (Program) Write a C++ program that defines a class capable of creating objects for storing the
name of a stock, its estimated earnings per share, and its estimated price-to-earnings ratio.
Have the program prompt the user to enter these items for five different stocks. When data
has been entered for a particular stock, have the program compute and display the anticipated
stock price based on the entered earnings and price-per-earnings values. For example, if a user
enters the data XYZ 1.56 12, the anticipated price for a share of XYZ stock is (1.56)*(12)
= $18.72.
