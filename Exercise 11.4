1. (Modify) a. Replace the operator[] function in Program 11.9 with the operator() function.

b. Include the operator() function written for Exercise 1a in a working C++ program and
verify its operation.

2. (Modify) a. Replace the operator[] function in Program 11.9 with a member operator()
function that accepts an integer month, day, and year count. Have the function add the input
days, months, and years to the object’s date and return the resulting date. For example, if the
input is 3, 2, 1 and the object’s date is 7/16/2011, the function should return the date 10/18/2012.
Make sure your function correctly handles an input such as 37 days and 15 months and adjusts
the calculated day to be within the range 1 to 30 and the month to be within the range 1 to 12.
Therefore, if the input is 37, 15, 1 and the object’s date is 7/16/2011, the function should return
the date 9/1/2015.

b. Include the operator() function written for Exercise 2a in a working C++ program and
verify its operation.

3. (Program) a. Construct a class named Student consisting of these private data members: an
integer ID number, an integer count, and an array of four double-precision grades. The constructor
for this class should set all data member values to 0. The class should also include a
member function that displays all valid member grades, as determined by the grade count, and
calculates and displays the average of the grades. Include the class in a working C++ program
that declares three class objects named a, b, and c.

b. Modify the class constructed for Exercise 3a to include a member operator[] function
that has a double-precision grade count argument. The function should check the grade
count data member and, if fewer than four grades have been entered, store its argument in
the grade array, using the count as an index value. If four grades have already been entered,
the function should return an error message indicating that the new grade can’t be accepted.
Additionally, a new grade should force an increment to the count data member.

c. Modify the class constructed for Exercise 3a to include a member operator() function
that has a grade index and grade value as arguments. The function should force a change to
the grade corresponding to the index value and update the count, if necessary. For example,
an argument list of 4, 98.5 should change the fourth test grade value to 98.5.

4. (Modify) a. Modify Program 10.9 to include a member operator[] function that multiplies
an object’s complex number (both the real and the imaginary parts) by a real number and
returns a complex number. For example, if the real number is 2 and the complex number is
3 + 4i, the result is 6 + 8i.

b. Verify the operation of the operator[] function written for Exercise 4a by including it in
a working C++ program.
