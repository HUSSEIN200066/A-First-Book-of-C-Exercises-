1. (Modify) Replace the while statement in Program 8.10 with a for statement.



2. (Program) a. Write a program that stores the following numbers in an array named rates:
6.25, 6.50, 6.8, 7.2, 7.35, 7.5, 7.65, 7.8, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8, and 9.0. Display the values in the array
by changing the address in a pointer called dispPt. Use a for statement in your program.



b. Modify the program written in Exercise 2a to use a while statement.



3. (Program) a. Write a program that stores the string Hooray for All of Us in an array
named strng. Use the declaration strng[] =“Hooray for All of Us”;, which ensures
that the end-of-string escape sequence \0 is included in the array. Display the characters in
the array by changing the address in a pointer called messPt. Use a for statement in your
program.



b. Modify the program written in Exercise 3a to use the while statement while
(*messPt++ != '\0').



c. Modify the program written in Exercise 3a to start the display with the word All.



4. (Program) Write a program that stores the following numbers in the array named miles: 15,
22, 16, 18, 27, 23, and 20. Have your program copy the data stored in miles to another array
named dist, and then display the values in the dist array. Your program should use pointer
notation when copying and displaying array elements.



5. (Program) Write a C++ program that stores the following letters in the array named message:
This is a test. Have your program copy the data stored in message to another array
named mess2 and then display the letters in the mess2 array.



6. (Program) Write a program that declares three one-dimensional arrays named miles,
gallons, and mpg. Each array should be capable of holding 10 elements. In the miles array,
store the numbers 240.5, 300.0, 189.6, 310.6, 280.7, 216.9, 199.4, 160.3, 177.4, and 192.3. In the
gallons array, store the numbers 10.3, 15.6, 8.7, 14, 16.3, 15.7, 14.9, 10.7, 8.3, and 8.4. Each
element of the mpg array should be calculated as the corresponding element of the miles array
divided by the equivalent element of the gallons array: for example, mpg[0] =miles[0]
/ gallons[0]. Use pointers when calculating and displaying the elements of the mpg array.
