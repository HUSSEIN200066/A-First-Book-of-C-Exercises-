1. (Practice) Determine data types suitable for the following data:
a. The average of four grades
b. The number of days in a month
c. The length of the Golden Gate Bridge
d. The numbers in a state lottery
e. The distance from Brooklyn, N.Y. to Newark, N.J.
f. The single-character prefix that specifies a component type
2. (Practice) Compile and run Program 2.1.
3. (Modify) Modify Program 2.1 to determine the storage your compiler uses for all the C++
integer data types.
4. (Practice) Show how the name KINGSLEY is stored in a computer that uses the ASCII code
by drawing a diagram similar to Figure 2.3, shown previously.
5. (Practice) Repeat Exercise 4, using the letters of your own last name.
6. (Modify) Modify Program 2.1 to determine how many bytes your compiler assigns to the
float, double, and longƒdouble data types.
7. (Practice) Convert the following numbers from exponential form to standard decimal form:
a. 6.34e5
b. 1.95162e2
c. 8.395e1
d. 2.95e-3
e. 4.623e-4
8. (Practice) Convert the following numbers from scientific notation to standard decimal form:
a. 2.67 X 103
b. 2.67 X 10-3
c. 1.872 X 109
d. 1.872 X 10-9
e. 6.6256 X 10-34
9. (Practice) Write the following decimal numbers in scientific notation:
a. 126.
b. 656.23
c. 3426.95
d. 4893.2
e. .321
f. .0123
g. .006789

10. (For thought) Because computers use different representations for storing integer, floatingpoint,
double-precision, and character values, discuss how a program might alert the computer
to the data types of different values it will be using.
11. (For thought) Although you have concentrated on operations involving integer and floatingpoint
numbers, C++ allows adding and subtracting characters and integers. (These operations
are possible with characters because they’re integer data types and are stored by using integer
codes.) Therefore, characters and integers can be mixed in arithmetic expressions. For example,
if your computer uses the ASCII code, the expression 'a'ƒ+ƒ1 equals 'b' and 'z' - 1
equals 'y'. Similarly, 'A'+1 is 'B' and 'Z'-1 is 'Y'. With this information as background,
determine the character results of the following expressions. (Assume all characters
are stored by using ASCII codes.)
a. 'm'- ƒ
b. 'm'+ 5
c. 'G'+ 6
d. 'G'- 6
e. 'b'+ 7
f. 'g'- 1
g. 'G'- 1

12. (Practice) Although the total number of bytes varies from computer to computer, memory
sizes of 65,536 to more than several million bytes are common. In computer language, the
letter K represents the number 1024, which is 2 raised to the 10th power, and M represents the
number 1,048,576, which is 2 raised to the 20th power. Therefore, a memory size of 640 KB is
really 640 times 1024 (655,360 bytes), and a memory size of 4 MB is really 4 times 1,048,576
(4,194,304 bytes). Using this information, calculate the actual number of bytes in the following:
a. A memory containing 512 MB
b. A memory consisting of 256 MB words, with each word consisting of 2 bytes
c. A memory consisting of 256 MB words, with each word consisting of 4 bytes
d. A thumb drive that specifies 2 MB
e. A disk that specifies 250 MB
f. A disk that specifies 8 GB (Hint: See Table 2.6.)
