1. (Practice) A function named pFile() is to receive a filename as a reference to an ifstream
object. What declarations are required to pass a filename to pFile()?
2. (Practice) Write a function named fcheck() that checks whether a file exists. The function
should accept an ifstream object as a formal reference parameter. If the file exists, the function
should return a value of 1; otherwise, the function should return a value of 0.
3. (Practice) A data file consisting of a group of lines has been created. Write a function named
printLine() that reads and displays any line of the file. For example, the function called
printLine(fstream&Æ’fName,5); should display the fifth line of the passed object stream.
4. (Modify) Rewrite the getOpen() function used in Program 9.9 to incorporate the file-checking
procedures described in this section. Specifically, if the entered filename exists, an appropriate
message should be displayed. The user should be given the option of entering a new filename
or allowing the program to overwrite the existing file. Use the function written for Exercise 2
in your program.
