1. (Practice) A function named pFile() is to receive a filename as a reference to an ifstream
object. What declarations are required to pass a filename to pFile()?

// within the main() function
string fname = "pass.dat";
void pFile(ifstream&);
ifstream inFile;
inFile.open(fname.c_str());
pFile(inFile);

// within the pFile function
void pFile(ifstream& fileIn){

}

2. (Practice) Write a function named fcheck() that checks whether a file exists. The function
should accept an ifstream object as a formal reference parameter. If the file exists, the function
should return a value of 1; otherwise, the function should return a value of 0.

int fcheck(ifstream& fileIn)
{
	string name;
	cout << "\nEnter a filename : ";
	getline(cin, name);
	fileIn.open(name.c_str());      // 
	if (fileIn.fail())      // check for successful open
	{
		cout << "Cannot open the file" << endl;
		exit(1);
		return 0;
	}
	else{
		return 1;
	}
}

3. (Practice) A data file consisting of a group of lines has been created. Write a function named
printLine() that reads and displays any line of the file. For example, the function called
printLine(fstream& fName,5); should display the fifth line of the passed object stream.



4. (Modify) Rewrite the getOpen() function used in Program 9.9 to incorporate the file-checking
procedures described in this section. Specifically, if the entered filename exists, an appropriate
message should be displayed. The user should be given the option of entering a new filename
or allowing the program to overwrite the existing file. Use the function written for Exercise 2
in your program.
