1. (Practice) Define the following terms:
a. Exception
b. try block
c. catch block
d. Exception handler
e. Throw an exception
f. Catch an exception
2. (Practice) Enter and run Program 14.14.
3. (Modify) Replace the following statement in Program 14.14
cout << numerator <<'/' << denominator
     << “ = “ << double (numerator)/ double (denominator) << endl;
with the statement
cout << numerator <<'/' << denominator
     << “ = “ << numerator/denominator << endl;
and run the modified program. Enter the values 12 and 5, and explain why the result is incorrect
from the user’s viewpoint.
4. (Modify) Modify Program 14.14 so that it throws and catches the message ***Invalid input
-A denominator value of zero is not permitted***. (Hint: Review the caution at
the end of this section.)
5. (Modify) Modify Program 14.14 so that the try and catch blocks are included in a while
statement. The while statement should provide code that continuously requests the user to
enter a denominator until a non-zero number is entered. (Hint: The prompt to enter a new
denominator should be made in the catch block immediately after the message informing the
user an invalid denominator has been entered.)
6. (Modify) Modify Program 14.14 so that it continues to divide two numbers until the user
enters the number 999 (as a numerator or denominator) to terminate program execution.
