1. (Practice) Enter and run Program 14.2.

//Done!!

#include "stdafx.h" 
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	string message;    // declare a string object
	cout << "Enter a string : \n";
	getline(cin, message);
	cout << "The string just entered is : \n"
		<< message << endl;
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}

2. (Practice) Determine the value of text.at(0), text.at(3), and text.at(10), assuming
for each one that text is each of the following strings:
a. Now is the time

text.at(0) = N
text.at(3) = (space)
text.at(10) = t

b. Rocky raccoon welcomes you

text.at(0) = N
text.at(3) = (space)
text.at(10) = t

c. Happy Holidays

text.at(0) = R
text.at(3) = k
text.at(10) = o

d. The good ship

text.at(0) = T
text.at(3) = (space)
text.at(10) = i

3. (Practice) Enter and run Program 14.5.

4. (Modify) Modify Program 14.5 to count and display the numbers of each vowel contained in
the string.

5. (Modify) Modify Program 14.5 to display the number of vowels in a user-entered string.

6. (Program) Using the at() method, write a C++ program that reads in a string by using
getline(), stores the string in a string object named message, and then displays the
string in reverse order. (Hint: After the string has been entered and saved, retrieve and display
characters, starting from the end of the string. The last character is located at the position
message.length()ƒ-ƒ1.)

7. (Program) Write a C++ program that accepts both a string and a single character from the
user. The program should determine how many times the character is contained in the string.
(Hint: Search the string by using the find(str,ƒind) method. This method should be used
in a loop that starts the index value at 0 and then changes the index value to 1 past the index
of where the char was last found.)



8. (Practice) Enter and run Program 14.6.


9. (Practice) Enter and run Program 14.7.
