1. (Practice) Determine the value of the following expressions, assuming a = 5, b = 2, c = 4,
d = 6, and e = 3:

a. a > b
b. a != b
c. d % b == c % b
d. a * c != d * b
e. d * b == c * e
f. a * b
g. a % b * c
h. c % b * a
i. b % c * a
2. (Practice) Using parentheses, rewrite the following expressions to indicate their order of
evaluation correctly. Then evaluate each expression, assuming a = 5, b = 2, and c = 4.
a. a % b * c && c % b * a
b. a % b * c || c % b * a
c. b % c * a && a % c * b
d. b % c * a || a % c * b
3. (Practice) Write relational expressions to express the following conditions (using variable
names of your choosing):
a. A person’s age is equal to 30.
b. A person’s temperature is greater than 98.6 degrees.
c. A person’s height is less than 6 feet.
d. The current month is 12 (December).
e. The letter input is m.
f. A person’s age is equal to 30, and the person is taller than 6 feet.
g. The current day is the 15th day of the 1st month.
h. A person is older than 50 or has been employed at the company for at least 5 years.
i. A person’s identification number is less than 500 and the person is older than 55.
j. A length is greater than 2 feet and less than 3 feet.
4. (Practice) Determine the value of the following expressions, assuming a = 5, b = 2, c = 4,
and d = 5:
a. a == 5
b. b * d == c * c
c. d % b * c > 5 || c % b * d < 7
