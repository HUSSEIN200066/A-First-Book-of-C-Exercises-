1. (Modify) Rewrite the following if-else chain by using a switch statement:
 if (letterGrade == 'A')
   cout << “The numerical grade is between 90 and 100\n”;
 else if (letterGrade == 'B')
   cout << “The numerical grade is between 80 and 89.9\n”;
 else if (letterGrade == 'C')
   cout << “The numerical grade is between 70 and 79.9\n”;
 else if (letterGrade == 'D')
   cout << “How are you going to explain this one?\n”;
 else
 {
   cout << “Of course I had nothing to do with my grade.\n”;
   cout << “It must have been the professor's fault.\n”;
 }
2. (Modify) Rewrite the following if-else chain by using a switch statement:
 if (bondType == 1)
 {
   inData();
   check();
 }
 else if (bondType == 2)
 {
    dates();
   leapYr();
 }
 else if (bondType == 3)
 {
   yield();
   maturity();
 }
 else if (bondType == 4)
 {
   price();
   roi();
 }
 else if (bondType == 5)
 {
   files();
   save();
 }
 else if (bondType == 6)
 {
   retrieve();
   screen();
 }
3. (Program) Each storage drive in a shipment is stamped with a code from 1 to 4, indicating
the following storage capacities:
Code Capacity
1 2 GB
2 4 GB
3 16 GB
4 32 GB
Write, compile, and run a C++ program that accepts the code number as an input value and,
based on the value entered, displays the correct storage drive capacity.
4. (Modify) Rewrite Program 4.4 by using a switch statement.
5. (Modify) Repeat Exercise 9 in Section 4.3, using a switch statement instead of an
if-else chain.
6. (Modify) Rewrite Program 4.6 by using a character variable for the select code.
7. (For thought) Determine why the if-else chain in Program 4.5 can’t be replaced with a
switch statement.
