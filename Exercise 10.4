1. (Practice) Enter and run Program 10.5 on your computer.



2. (Modify) Modify the main() function in Program 10.5 to create a second room with a length
of 9 and a width of 12. Have the program calculate this new room’s area.



3. (Modify) a. Modify the main() function in Program 10.5 to create four rooms: hall, kitchen,
dining room, and living room. The dimensions for these rooms are as follows:
Hall: length = 12.40, width = 3.5
Kitchen: length = 14, width = 14
Living room: length = 12.4, width = 20
Dining room: length = 14, width = 10.5.
Your program should display the area of each room and the total area of all four rooms combined.



4. (Practice) Enter and run Program 10.6 on your computer.



5. (Modify) a. Modify the main() function in Program 10.6 to put a second elevator in service
starting at the 5th floor and have a maximum floor of 20. Have this second elevator move to
the 1st floor and then move to the 12th floor.



b. Verify that the constructor is called by adding a message in it that’s displayed each time a
new object is created. Run your program to verify its operation.



6. (Modify) Modify the main() function in Program 10.6 to use a while loop that calls the
Elevator’s request() method with a random number between 1 and 15. If the random
number is the same as the elevator’s current floor, generate another request. The while loop
should terminate after five valid requests have been made and be satisfied by movement of
the elevator. (Hint: Review Section 6.8 about the use of random numbers.)



7. (Program) Construct a class named Light that simulates a traffic light. The class’s color
attribute should change from Green to Yellow to Red and then back to Green by using the
class’s change() method. When a new Light object is created, its initial color should be Red.



8. (Program) a. Construct a class definition to represent an employee of a company. Each
employee is defined by an integer ID number, a double-precision pay rate, and the maximum
number of hours the employee should work each week. The class should provide these services:
the capability to enter data for a new employee, the capability to change data for a new
employee, and the capability to display existing data for a new employee.



b. Include the class definition created for Exercise 8a in a working C++ program that asks the
user to enter data for three employees and then displays the entered data.



c. Modify the program written for Exercise 8b to include a menu that offers the user the following
choices:
1. Add an employee
2. Modify employee data
3. Delete an employee
4. Exit this menu
In response to the user’s choice, the program should initiate an action to implement the
choice.



9. (Program) a. Construct a class definition to represent types of food. A type of food is classified
as basic or prepared. Basic foods are further classified as Dairy, Meat, Fruit, Vegetable,
or Grain. The class should provide these services: the capability to enter data for a new food,
the capability to change data for a new food, and the capability to display existing data for a
new food.



b. Include the class definition created for Exercise 9a in a working C++ program that asks the
user to enter data for four food items and then displays the entered data.



c. Modify the program written for Exercise 9b to include a menu that offers the user the following
choices:
1. Add a food item
2. Modify a food item
3. Delete a food item
4. Exit this menu
In response to the user’s choice, the program should initiate an action to implement the
choice.
