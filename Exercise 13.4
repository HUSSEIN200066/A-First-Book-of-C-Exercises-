1. (Review) State whether a queue, a stack, or neither object is appropriate for each of the following
tasks, and indicate why or why not:
a. A list of customers waiting to be seated in a restaurant

A queue would work best because the customers will be seated in the order they arrive.

b. A group of student tests waiting to be graded

A stack would work best because the papers can be graded easier starting from the last person who turned in a paper

c. An address book listing names and phone numbers in alphabetical order

Neither the information has already been orginazed and there is no task be be completed

d. Patients waiting for examinations in a doctor’s office

A queue would work best because it will allow each patient to come and go in the order they arrived in.

3. (Modify) Modify Program 13.4 to use a queue of integers rather than a queue of strings.



4. (Program) Write a C++ program that allows a user to enter a maximum of 20 characters in a
queue. Then have the program sort the queue contents in increasing order. For example, if the
queue’s contents are initially D, E, A, and B, its final contents are A, B, D, and E.



5. (Program) Write a queue program that accepts an object consisting of an integer ID number
and a double-precision hourly pay rate.

to the queue, removing a name from the queue, or listing the queue’s contents without removing
any objects from it.
